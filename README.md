# Overview:
    Build an employee reimbursement portal where users can manage companies, create employee, and submit reimbursement claims. The portal should provide basic user authentication, allow users to associate employees with companies, and enable employees to raise reimbursement claims with details such as purpose, amount, and date of expenditure. The application can be styled using the CSS of your choice.

# Requirements:
User Authentication:
●  Implement user authentication using a username and password.
●   Authentication is required for all actions within the portal.

 #  Companies and employees:
●   Users can create and manage multiple companies.
●   Each company should have a name, employee count, and the sum of reimbursement claims in the UI.
●   Users can create employee records and associate each employee with a specific company.
●   There is no need to implement role management or permissions; any authenticated usercan perform these actions.
  
 # Reimbursement Claims:
●    Users can submit reimbursement claims on behalf of employees.
●    Each reimbursement claim should include the following details:
●    Purpose: A description of the reason for the reimbursement.
●    Amount: The amount requested for reimbursement.
●    Date of Expenditure: The date on which the expenditure was incurred.
